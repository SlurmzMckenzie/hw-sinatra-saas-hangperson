Pair Programming

Unfortunately this week I was unable to have a pair programming session. 
I work full time and I am trying to fit this in around work, but I have been flat out at work for the last week and I had organised a pair programming session for tonight, but got a flat tyre on my ride home so was delayed and was unable to make the scheduled session.

I did not have any other method to record a video of me completing the homework, and I did not want to take time to set it up because I was already working against the deadline and have only managed to finish this now at 1:27am in my timezone.
